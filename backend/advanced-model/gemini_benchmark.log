If the undertaking, which is being sold under slump sale was held by the transferor Indian company for more than 36 months, the capital gains realized on such sale would be taxed as LTCG, i.e. at the rate of 20% (exclusive of surcharge and education cess).

C. Capital Gains Tax Implications for a Slump Sale A slump sale is a transaction by way of ‘sale’ as a result of which the transferor transfers one or more of its undertakings on a going concern basis for a lump sum consideration, without assigning values to the individual assets and liabilities of the undertaking.97 For the purpose of computing capital gains, the cost of acquisition would be the ‘net worth’ of the undertaking on the date of the transfer.98 The ‘net worth’ of the undertaking shall be determined by calculating the difference between the aggregate value of total assets and aggregate value of total liabilities as per the books of accounts of the seller.
